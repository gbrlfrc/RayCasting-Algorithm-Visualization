# RayCasting-Algorithm-Visualization
A visualization of how Ray Casting algorithm works

Ray Casting is the methodological basis for 3D solid modeling and image rendering. <br/>
As Ray Tracing for computer graphics where virtual light rays are "cast" or "traced" on their path from the focal point of a comera
 through each pixel to determinate what is visible along that path in the scene
